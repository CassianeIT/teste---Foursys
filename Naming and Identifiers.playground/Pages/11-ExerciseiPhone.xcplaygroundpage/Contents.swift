let iPhoneStorageTotal = 8000

let iphoneStorageOcupied = 3000

let iphoneStorageAvaliable = iPhoneStorageTotal - iphoneStorageOcupied

let totalMinuteVideo = iphoneStorageAvaliable / 150
//150 equivale a 1 minuto de videos (33 minutos)

//solucao Willian
let iPhoneHDinMB = 8000
let usedSpace = 3000
let videoMinuteMB = 150

let minutesAvailable = (iPhoneHDinMB - usedSpace) / videoMinuteMB
